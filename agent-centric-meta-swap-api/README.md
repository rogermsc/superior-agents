# Agent-Centric Meta Swap API

This repository contains an enhanced version of the Meta Swap API specifically designed to support autonomous self-learning AI agents. It transforms a standard token swap API into a comprehensive platform for agent learning, experimentation, and deployment in DeFi environments.

## Key Features

### Agent-Centric API Design
- Specialized endpoints for agent interaction
- Observation and action spaces optimized for ML consumption
- Built-in reward signals for reinforcement learning
- Dynamic rate limiting based on agent learning patterns

### Learning Environment
- Simulation mode for risk-free agent training
- Historical market replay capabilities
- Scenario generation for targeted learning
- Time acceleration for faster training cycles

### Agent Performance Analytics
- Comprehensive telemetry for tracking agent decisions
- Standardized benchmarks for strategy comparison
- Learning progress visualization
- Decision process explainability tools

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Agent communication protocols
- Shared memory spaces for collaborative learning
- Role specialization support
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-centric-meta-swap-api.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd agent-centric-meta-swap-api

# Copy environment variables template
cp .env.example .env

# Build and start the container
docker compose up --build
```

## Architecture Overview

The platform extends the original Meta Swap API with several new modules:
